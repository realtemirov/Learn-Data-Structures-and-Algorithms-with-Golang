## Hello World !

This is the traditional "Hello World" program in Go. It is the first program that most people write when they are learning a new programming language. The program prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
You can run the program below by copying the code into a file named `hello-world.go` and running `go run hello-world.go` in your terminal.

## Section 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms and the Go Language

We will be introducing the abstract data types, definition, and classification of data
structures. Readers will be well-versed with performance analysis of algorithms and
choosing appropriate data structures for structural design patterns after reading this part.

## Chapter 1: Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms, focuses on the definition of abstract data types,
classifying data structures into linear, non-linear, homogeneous, heterogeneous, and
dynamic types. Abstract data types, such as container, list, set, map, graph, stack, and
queue, are presented in this chapter. This chapter also covers the performance analysis of
data structures, as well as the correct choice of data structures and structural design
patterns

## Chapter 2: Getting Started with Go for Data Structures and Algorithms Technical requirements

Getting Started with Go for Data Structures and Algorithms, covers Go-specific data
structures, such as arrays, slices, two-dimensional slices, maps, structs, and channels.
Variadic functions, deferred function calls, and panic and recover operations are
introduced. Slicing operations, such as enlarging using append and copy, assigning parts,
appending a slice, and appending part of a slice, are also presented in this chapter.
